## Projects 👔

### [Personal portfolio](https://fabriziocl-portfolio.vercel.app/)
My personal portfolio is a compilation of my projects so far. It's something that I had been planning for a long time, ever since graduating the bootcamp. I wanted to portray my ambition to create an application that could use one of the most up-to-date technologies, including Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This experience was a great opportunity for me to learn and gain practical knowledge in the latest web development tools and frameworks. 

I was very hyped about using Tailwind CSS to craft modern and visually appealing designs that could enhance the user experience. Customizing, testing elements, making color combinations and adding responsiveness was made very easy by this great framework.
I was able to add TypeAnimation, Framer Motion and React Social Icons to provide a more dynamic and attractive style.

It was both challenging and rewarding at the same time to work new technologies, get to know them and keep the fire burning.

### [Vivero Henry](https://vivero-henry.vercel.app/)
Vivero Henry is an e-commerce platform for plants and supplies that I developed with a talented team of developers during my time at HENRY. The website was built using modern web development technologies, including React, Redux, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and is deployed on Vercel and Railway. Our team worked on all aspects of the project, from designing and implementing the user interface to building the backend API and integrating payment and shipping services.

One of the most exciting aspects of working on Vivero Henry was the opportunity to learn and apply new skills in a real-world setting. I also learned how to collaborate with a team and use version control tools such as Git and GitHub. We tackled complex challenges, such as implementing a custom search function and integrating with third-party APIs, and worked collaboratively to find innovative solutions. 

Overall, the project was a fantastic opportunity to gain hands-on experience with modern web development tools and techniques and to work collaboratively with a team of passionate developers.

### [Dogs CRUD](https://dogs-ip.vercel.app/)

Dogs CRUD was my very first experience creating a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, and it was an exciting and challenging project. The goal of the project was to build a simple web application that allowed users to create, view, edit, and delete information about dogs.

To create the application, I used a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. I leveraged the power of RESTful APIs to create a robust and scalable architecture that could handle a large number of requests.

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was implementing the CRUD operations in a secure and efficient manner. I had to consider issues such as authentication, data validation, and error handling, which required a deep understanding of the technologies involved.

Despite the challenges, I found the project to be a fantastic learning experience. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience with a wide range of web development tools and techniques, including the PERN stack, RESTful APIs, and CRUD operations.

Overall, Dogs CRUD was an exciting and challenging project that gave me a solid foundation in full-stack web development and sparked my passion for building web applications.
